# Tileset with request volume
## Description
The tileset shows off the `requestVolume` property of a tile. When the viewer is inside the request volume of the point cloud, the point cloud is rendered.
In addition this sample illustrates loading an external tileset from within the main `tileset.json`.

When running in Cesium, use the `3d-tiles-proximity` branch.
